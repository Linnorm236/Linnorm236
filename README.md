## Looking to Collaborate On ヘ(°￢°)ノ

- Hosting fun workshops for hands-on learning experiences, where we can collaboratively figure things out

## Fun Fact ԅ(≖‿≖ԅ)

Learned CSS by copying the styles of popular sites. I got so good at it that I could trick someone into thinking they were on the official site… when, in fact, they were browsing my little imitation. Turns out I’m pretty convincing when it comes to banking sites!
