# 👋 Hi, I’m @Linnorm236

## 🔎 What I Do  
I specialize in auditing and improving WordPress sites. I run thorough quality checks to protect sites from:

- Vulnerable, outdated, or nulled plugins  
- Poor coding practices that expose security risks  

My goal is to make sure developers don’t leave their clients “screwed over.”

## 🎨 Front‑End Passion  
I love working with modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, container queries, etc.) and building sleek, responsive UIs. Whether it’s a brand‑new interface or a redesign of an existing open‑source project, I enjoy turning designs into clean, performant code.

## 🚀 Current Learning Journey  
- **Astro framework** – exploring its component model and server‑side rendering capabilities  
- Advanced CSS features (container queries, subgrid, cascade layers)  
- Modern build tooling (Vite, ESBuild)

## 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On  
- Open‑source UI libraries or component kits  
- WordPress security audits & remediation projects  
- Front‑end rewrites that leverage Astro, React, or Vue  

If you have a project that could benefit from a security‑first, UI‑focused approach, let’s chat!

## ⚡ Fun Fact  
I once rescued a site that was running a **nulled premium plugin** with a known remote‑code‑execution flaw—after a quick audit and patch, the site was back online and fully secured within a day.
