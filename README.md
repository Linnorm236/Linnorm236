# Hi, I’m Linnorm ☚(ﾟヮﾟ☚)

## My Toolbox ᕙ(`▽´)ᕗ

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, Rust
- **Frameworks:** NodeJS, Astro, Three.js, Laravel, Tauri 
- **Software:** Zed, Firefox, Chromium, Blender, Inkscape, GIMP, Krita

## What I Do (╭ರ_•́)

- Spend most of my time auditing and improving sites
- Writing custom CSS to give sites a face-lift to spare clients the egregious subscription fees of plugins/themes
- Rebuilding entire site if it was made especially bad by self-proclaimed "experts"
- Also make personlised video tutorials for clients to educate them on how to use their WordPress instance

## Currently Learning ＼(-_- )

- **Astro Framework** - server‑side rendering + islands architecture  
- **Tauri Framework** - creating Windows/Linux/Android applications
- **Blender Software** - creating 3D models and integrating them into websites
- **Advanced CSS** - container queries, scroll-driven animations, functions
- **Video Editing** - animations, transition, etc. to make more "professional" video tutorials
- **Caddy (Server)** - setting up my own hosting enviroment for local projects

## Looking to Collaborate On \(˚☐˚”)/

- Open‑source UI libraries or component kits  
- WordPress security audits & remediation projects  
- Front‑end UI rewrites that leverage Astro 

## Fun Fact ¯\(°_o)/¯

Learned CSS by copying the styles of popular sites. I got so good at it that I could trick someone into thinking they were on the official site… when, in fact, they were browsing my little imitation. Turns out I’m pretty convincing when it comes to banking sites! **ԅ(≖‿≖ԅ)**
